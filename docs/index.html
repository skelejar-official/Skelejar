                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Payne's downfall wasn't due to poor planning or lack of resources, but his inability to execute a successful crime without savoring the power it gave him over his victims and the police. The flaw is his **Ego**: he needed to explain his genius, gloat over his victory, and engage in the games. This need for dialogue and attention gave the heroes the time and opportunity they needed to defeat him. Had he simply detonated the bus or immediately collected the ransom, he might have succeeded.

                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Thanos's goal—to achieve permanent balance and prevent inevitable collapse—was based on a **Logical Flaw**. The Snap only halved the population, a solution that would be temporary in the face of exponential resource consumption. The critical mistake was believing a one-time kill-off was sufficient, rather than rewriting the laws of the universe (which he could have done with the Gauntlet) to ensure resources perpetually regenerated. His logic was tragically finite.

                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                    Darth Vader's dark path began with his inability to let go of **Personal Attachment** (to Padmé). His final downfall was a direct result of the same flaw: he could not stand by and watch his son, Luke, be tortured and killed by the Emperor. His love for his son—the single remnant of his old life—forced him to reject his identity as a Sith Lord, leading to the destruction of the Emperor and himself. His greatest weakness was his family bond.
