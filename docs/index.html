                            Darth Vader’s entire existence was built upon rejecting his past and embracing the cold, calculated power of the Dark Side. He severed ties with his humanity, his name (Anakin Skywalker), and his emotional attachments—or so he thought. His single, catastrophic flaw was his **paternal love** for Luke Skywalker. This attachment, which he himself claimed to have abandoned, was the one emotion the Emperor could not foresee him acting upon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Emperor’s plan to replace Vader with Luke was sound, but it failed to account for the primal, overriding instinct of a father protecting his son from mortal harm. When Palpatine began torturing Luke, the part of Anakin that Vader had buried resurfaced. In that moment of pure, selfless protection, Vader sacrificed his own life and allegiance to save his child, fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One not by destroying the Sith but by **choosing love over power**.

                        <p>
                            Thanos was defined by his unwavering certainty that he was the only one who could save the universe from itself. His plan was mathematically perfect: eliminate half of all life to ensure the survival of the rest. His flaw was his **arrogance of destiny**—his absolute belief that no one could possibly undo his "great work."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This arrogance led to two critical mistakes. First, after the Snap, he retired to a secluded farm, believing the fight was over, giving the Avengers time to regroup. Second, and most critically, when he finally confronted Iron Man, he paused for a moment of self-satisfaction before snapping his fingers, declaring, "I am inevitable." This pause allowed Tony Stark the precious seconds he needed to steal the Infinity Stones right from his gauntlet. Thanos’s need for the final, triumphant declaration was his fatal distraction, proving that even destiny is susceptible to pride.

                        <p>
                            The Joker claims to be an agent of pure chaos, seeking to prove that society is only one bad day away from anarchy. However, his true motivation is not destruction, but a symbiotic relationship with Batman. His fatal flaw is his **dependence on Batman** for validation and purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In his grand scheme to break Gotham by having two ferries blow each other up, The Joker failed to realize that his chaos experiment depended on the core morality he was trying to disprove. The people chose to be good. Furthermore, his entire existence is meaningless without the "straight man" to react to his performance. He requires Batman to uphold order so he can defy it. By failing to kill Batman, and instead requiring him as a counterpoint to his "chaos," The Joker ensures his own cyclical defeat. He can never win because winning means losing his purpose.
