                        <p>
                            Lord Voldemort, the Dark Lord who terrorized the wizarding world, was the most powerful dark wizard of his time. His mastery of magic, strategic brilliance, and ruthless ambition made him nearly unstoppable. Yet, despite all his power, he was defeated not by superior magic, but by a <strong>single, fatal misunderstanding</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Voldemort's greatest flaw was his <strong>inability to understand love</strong> — not as weakness, but as a force more powerful than any spell. This wasn't mere arrogance; it was a <em>philosophical blind spot</em> that shaped every decision he made.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-accent-red mt-8 mb-4">The Prophecy Miscalculation</h3>
                        <p>
                            When Voldemort heard the prophecy about a child born to defeat him, he immediately sought to eliminate the threat. But he <strong>chose Harry Potter over Neville Longbottom</strong> because Harry was a half-blood like himself. This wasn't strategy — it was <em>ego</em>. He saw himself in Harry and couldn't resist targeting the "mirror" of his own origin.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-accent-red mt-8 mb-4">The Power of Lily's Sacrifice</h3>
                        <p>
                            The moment that sealed his fate: Lily Potter's willing sacrifice for her son. Voldemort <strong>offered her a chance to live</strong> — not out of mercy, but because Snape asked. When she refused, her love created ancient magic that <em>rebounded his Killing Curse</em>. He never anticipated this. To him, love was irrelevant. To magic itself, it was everything.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-accent-red mt-8 mb-4">The Horcrux Obsession</h3>
                        <p>
                            His fear of death led him to split his soul into seven pieces. But this act <strong>made him less human, less capable of understanding human bonds</strong>. Each Horcrux anchored him to life — but also to his own isolation. He couldn't fathom that Harry would <em>choose death</em> in the Forbidden Forest, or that Dumbledore's plan relied on Voldemort's own actions to destroy the Horcruxes.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-accent-red mt-8 mb-4">The Elder Wand Fiasco</h3>
                        <p>
                            In his final act of hubris, Voldemort believed mastery of the Elder Wand would make him invincible. But he <strong>never understood wand allegiance</strong>. The wand's true master was Draco (who disarmed Dumbledore), then Harry (who disarmed Draco). When Voldemort cast the Killing Curse at Harry in their final duel, the Elder Wand <em>refused to kill its true master</em> — and the curse rebounded.
