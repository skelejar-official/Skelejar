            <p>
              The Joker wasn't a criminal mastermind chasing money or power. He was a <strong>philosopher of chaos</strong> — a force that wanted to expose the fragility of civilization. His schemes weren't about winning. They were <em>experiments</em>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mt-8 mb-4">The Social Experiment</h3>
            <p>
              Two ferries. One full of citizens, one full of prisoners. Each given a detonator to blow up the other. <strong>"At midnight, I blow you both up. Unless one of you does it first."</strong> This was his thesis: <em>people are only one bad day away from becoming him</em>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mt-8 mb-4">The Harvey Dent Gambit</h3>
            <p>
              He turned Gotham's White Knight into Two-Face not for control, but to <strong>break Batman's rule</strong>. If he could make the hero kill, his worldview would be validated. But Batman refused — and Dent's coin flip became a symbol of <em>chance over ideology</em>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600 mt-8 mb-4">The Final Test</h3>
            <p>
              On the skyscraper, Joker believed he had won. But when the ferries <strong>refused to blow each other up</strong>, his entire philosophy collapsed. The citizens chose hope. The prisoners chose mercy. <em>Chaos lost.</em>
